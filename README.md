# Random Football Team Generator
Technical code challenge set as the final component of the DevelopMe Coding Fellowship.

## Deadline
Sunday 5th January 2019

## Brief
To create a tool which randomly picks a 5-a-side football team from a list of 10 names (10 players = 2 teams of 5). Optional advanced features may include:

* Support for n-a-side, where a list of any length can be split into two teams.
* Support for balancing of the teams, where some measure of each player's strength is used to allocate teams fairly.

## MVP
* An input for each player name that would allow the user to input 10 names.
* A button that generates two random teams based on the 10 names input by the user.
* A reset button which allows the user to reset the list of names input and enter new names if needed.
