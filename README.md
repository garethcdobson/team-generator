# Random Football Team Generator
Technical code challenge set as the final component of the DevelopMe Coding Fellowship.

## Deadline
Sunday 5th January 2019

## Brief
To create a tool which randomly picks a 5-a-side football team from a list of 10 names (10 players = 2 teams of 5). Optional advanced features may include:

* Support for n-a-side, where a list of any length can be split into two teams.
* Support for balancing of the teams, where some measure of each player's strength is used to allocate teams fairly.

## MVP
* An input for each player name that would allow the user to input 10 names.
* A button that generates two random teams based on the 10 names input by the user.
* A reset button which allows the user to reset the list of names input and enter new names if needed.

## Wireframes
### MVP First Drafts (Desktop)
![Wireframe Players](/wireframes/players.png)
![Wireframe Teams](/wireframes/teams.png)

Decision to base the layout on central columns as this provides a simple layout that is similar on both large desktop screens and smaller mobile devices. The mobile version will stack central columns on the team page to produce a suitable layout for smaller width screens such as mobiles and tablets. The initial wireframes are produced with the minimum viable product in mind, a simple web-based app that enables the user to input player names, and clear them in cases of error, and generate two randomly selected teams from these names. The wireframes above support the input of any amount of players and thus two teams of any equal size - the content containers will simply expand and vertical scroll used to navigate the page. 

#### Stretch Features
When the MVP is achieved, I would like to improve the app with two additional features: 
1. The ability to input player ability and balance the teams based on this input. 
2. The addition of player icons to make the app's interface more visually engaging.
